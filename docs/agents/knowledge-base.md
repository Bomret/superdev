# Knowledge base: GitHub Wiki

Durable, **human-first** reader-facing docs (guides, topic pages, concepts) live in the
GitHub repo **Wiki** for `Bomret/superdev`. Distinct from the agent-first in-repo `AGENTS.md` docs.
In-repo docs (`docs/agents/documentation.md`) remain the source of truth; the wiki is a published view.

## Configuration

- **Backend:** GitHub repo Wiki, reached as the git repository `https://github.com/Bomret/superdev.wiki.git`.
  GitHub offers no wiki API, so every command clones that repository, changes one file, and pushes.
- **Auth:** the `gh` CLI's stored login for `github.com`. Every clone and every push passes
  `gh auth git-credential` as its credential helper and runs with `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, so no command
  waits on a password prompt. No token environment variable is read. No `gh`, or a `gh` with no login for
  `github.com`, stops the step: each template below answers exit 2, "could not answer", and
  `/superdev:publish-kb` leaves the page staged.
- **Audience:** superdev **adopters** (the people who install and use the plugin) first, then
  **maintainers**.
- **Language:** English.
- **Hierarchy:** links. The wiki nests no pages. Each child page links from a list item in its parent's
  body, and `/superdev:publish-kb` writes that link (ADR 0168).

## Outline

This outline is a living skeleton. `/superdev:document` extends it.

- **Home.** The root page, with no parent. Hand-written: what superdev is, the plan and implement loop,
  and the compatibility note. Each section below holds one link list that `/superdev:publish-kb`
  maintains.
- **Guides.** One page per thing an adopter does, step by step. Parent: `Home`, section `Guides`:
  - `Guide: Audit tests`
  - `Guide: Check prose`
  - `Guide: Deploy after the merge`
  - `Guide: Install and configure`
  - `Guide: Plan a feature`
  - `Guide: Profile a run`
  - `Guide: Publish to the knowledge base`
  - `Guide: Scope the test runs`
  - `Guide: Ship and wrap up`
  - `Guide: Survey the backlog`
  - `Guide: Sweep a repository`
- **Topics.** One page per subject an adopter looks up: what superdev does there, where you meet it, and
  how to configure it. Parent: `Home`, section `Topics`:
  - `Planning a feature`: the plan interview, its criteria, design sketch and visuals, intent and triage
    records, the invariant register, and repairs.
  - `The command chain`: the commands, the order they run in, the offer of the next one, response
    shapes, the operator configuration, and Windows.
  - `Scope runs`: the scope branch and its worktrees, the run lock, the run root, run state, the guards,
    and the run trace.
  - `Review`: slice review, the fix loop, Minor findings, ad-hoc review, review models, unresolved
    defects, and triage records.
  - `Tests`: test cost, the fail-to-pass run, where a run runs the suite, suite reuse, and the test audit.
  - `Definition of Done and verification`: criterion ticks, the verification ceiling, and the criteria
    the doc pass settles.
  - `Documentation and knowledge base`: the doc loop, the writing standard, the content-type lens, the
    inline doc pass, topic pages, and parent links.
- **Concepts.** The terms an adopter configures or sizes: slice store, code host, documentation
  convention, knowledge base, toolchain, verification, execution tiers, unattended runs, deploy
  posture, seed gaps. `(aggregate)`: one `## <concept>` section per concept, contributed by the scope
  that built it. A mechanism belongs on its topic page, not here. Parent: `Home`, section `Concepts`.

**Every outline entry names a topic page** (ADR 0229, INV-0188). An entry gives one page's exact title,
and the page holds one subject a reader looks up. `/superdev:document`'s doc pass extends the topic page a
change touches. Only when no topic fits does it add one explicit entry here, in the scope's doc commit,
with its reason. A page per feature is no entry.

**Create the root page first.** A child published before its root lands, but stays staged as not linked,
because its parent has no page to carry the link yet.

**Links.** A parent's link line has the form `- [<title>](https://github.com/Bomret/superdev/wiki/{sub_url}): <one line>`.
`<title>` is the child's full title, prefix included. `{sub_url}` is written literally. The doc-writer writes
the whole line, placeholder included, and `/superdev:publish-kb` replaces `{sub_url}` with the value the find
call returns for the child once the child has landed. That value is not the title slugged by hand (see Wiki git conventions). `/superdev:publish-kb` then places the line after the last top-level list item of the named section's own content (ahead of any
subsection) and every line that item carries, or below the heading as its first list item when that content
holds none yet.

Decisions stay in the repository's `docs/adr/`, which the code host renders. The knowledge base carries
no ADR digest.

**Naming.** The prefix ends in a colon and one space. No trailing period. No `#` title heading in the
body: the wiki renders the page title itself. A page's `title` is the whole string, prefix included.

An `(aggregate)` page is staged one section at a time (`action: patch`) and merged into the live page
by that section's heading. Every other page is staged whole (ADR 0027).

## Staging

This is a **remote** backend, so nothing but `/superdev:publish-kb` calls it (ADR 0023).
The doc pass writes each page as a **staged page**: `/superdev:document` runs it, and on the `lite` tier
`/superdev:implement` runs it inline first. Each page is staged under `.superdev/kb-pending/<scope>/`. That directory lives in the main working tree, and `scope.js staging <scope>` resolves it (ADR 0119). Each
carries YAML frontmatter with the page `title` and an `action` of `upsert`, `patch`, or `delete`, and the
page body below. The wiki git conventions below are what `/superdev:publish-kb` applies when a human runs it,
once the feature has reached the adopters this wiki is written for.

## Wiki git conventions

- **A page is one file.** A page titled `<title>` is the file `<title with each space as ->.md` at the
  root of the wiki repository. GitHub renders the file name, with each `-` shown as a space, as the page
  title. That file name without `.md` is the page's `sub_url`, and its URL is
  `https://github.com/Bomret/superdev/wiki/<sub_url>`.
- **A title holds no `/`.** A `/` cannot be part of a file name at the wiki root. Each template reads the
  title with `jq -er` on its own, checks that status, and refuses a missing, non-string, empty, or `/`-holding title
  with exit 2 and its cause on stderr, before it clones anything.
- **A page never touches the file system.** Each template clones without a checkout and reads and writes
  the page through git objects, so a title holding `:` or another character a Windows file name cannot
  hold still works. The page file name matches exactly, case included, on every file system. A title that differs only in case from an existing page (`home`
  beside `Home.md`) therefore reads absent, and `create` adds a second page.
- **Only `.md` pages count.** A page GitHub renders from another extension, such as `.markdown`,
  `.asciidoc`, or `.rst`, reads as absent, and `create` adds a `.md` page beside it.
- **The page is absent** only when a clone succeeds and holds no file for the title. That is the only
  outcome `/superdev:publish-kb` §4 treats as positive absence (ADR 0027). A failed clone could not answer.
- **The wiki repository exists only once the wiki holds a page.** GitHub creates it when the first page is
  saved in the web editor. Until then every clone fails and every command answers exit 2.
- **A write that changes nothing lands nothing.** `create` and `update` answer exit 0 without a commit when
  the new tree equals the cloned one.
- If `gh` is missing or not logged in, or the wiki cannot be cloned, `/superdev:publish-kb` **leaves every
  page staged**, reports why, and deletes nothing. A later run retries exactly the pages that did not land.

## Commands

The **backend command contract** (ADR 0069) `scripts/publish-kb.js` runs. Each command runs as
`sh -c <template> sh <path>`: `$1` names a JSON file holding `title`, `bodyFile` (`create` and `update`),
the `find` result's fields under `found` (`read`, `update`, and `delete`), and the `knowledge-base`
section of `.superdev/info.json` under `operator` (ADR 0207). Every command reads its values from that
file with `jq`. `find` emits the page's `sub_url`, and `/superdev:publish-kb` fills a `parent-link`
target's `{sub_url}` from it (`sub_url` is the contract's optional named `find` key, ADR 0168). `find`
answers exit 3 only when the clone succeeded and holds no file for the title; any other failure answers
exit 2, "could not answer," so a page never gets created from a clone that failed. Every failure exit
writes its cause to stderr.

Every template opens with the same lines: check the `gh` login for `github.com`, read the title, shallow-clone
the wiki without a checkout into a temporary directory that is removed on exit, and derive the page file from the title. So
each one stands alone under the bound below. The templates use POSIX `sh` and options every platform's
tools accept.

Every command below runs under a **30-second bound** (ADR 0130), or whatever
`knowledge-base.timeoutMs` of `.superdev/info.json` names. `scripts/publish-kb.js` applies it at the spawn.
A command killed at the bound leaves its page staged and **stops the run**: the remaining pages are
reported untried and stay staged for the next one.

```

Human-consumption first: shape pages around the audience, write in English, follow the outline above.

## superdev usage

- `/superdev:document` reconciles and extends the wiki's topic pages through its doc-writer, and stages
  the pages it changed.
- `/superdev:implement` runs the same doc pass inline first on the `lite` tier, and stages the pages it
  changed; `/superdev:document`'s doc-writer then extends them.
- `/superdev:publish-kb` sends the staged pages to the wiki. The only command that calls it.

## Degrade / switching

No `gh`, no `gh` login for `github.com`, or a wiki that cannot be cloned → `/superdev:publish-kb` leaves every page
staged, reports why, and deletes nothing; a later run retries exactly the pages that did not land. The
in-repo docs are the record meanwhile. To move to a different knowledge base later, re-run
`/superdev:setup` and pick a different one.
